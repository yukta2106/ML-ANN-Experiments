# ML-ANN-Experiments
Built a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras to classify flowers from the Iris dataset into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Model uses 2 hidden layers (ReLU), softmax output, and cross-entropy loss. Trained for 50 epochs with ~95â€“100% accuracy, showing strong performance on test data.
